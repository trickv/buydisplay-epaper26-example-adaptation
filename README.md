# Overview
A simple adaptation of some library code from buydisplay.com for the 2.6" Red E-Paper display that I am tinkering with on a RaspberryPi.

# License
The license of the upstream code is unknown so I've reached out to buydisplay.com to ask.

# What it does
I'm not much of a C hacker, so I have just modified the wiringpi version of the demo to display a couple of .bmp files which I'll generate with another programming language.
